Please then follow the video of the basic set-up and copy so we have all we need to start as this is an important step for any programmer to have to learn when doing this.
//I could'nt add a video to the tutorial due to size of the file so here is a screenshot//


once you have the c# file open please start typing this code 
 bool canMove;
 bool dragging;
 this enables you to move the object you chose allowing the functionalilty to work 
 next step
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23966cf6-20a1-40a2-99cc-3d32a85ac6c6)
 so put this code in the void start section as this would not loop so please put this code in here for the functions.
 # Next step
 the next line of code is a important as it builds up on the main functions as these will enable you to add core parts of the code as this will allow proper functions
